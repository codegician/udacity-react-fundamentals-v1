These are just some of my personal notes that I'm using to organize my thoughts as I develop these projects.

The mind-blowing parts of React are:

- Ease of getting started
  - It's just JavaScript
  - Simple top-level API and DOM interop
- Ease of data management
  - It's explicit, easy to follow flow
  - You don't need a "model layer"
- Ease of state management
  - State is source of truth
  - State can be encapsulated in a component
- Cross-platform story
  - React Native
  - Server rendering
